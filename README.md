#  Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering  

### Data-driven segmentation of online retail customers based on purchase behavior  

---

## üìã Project Overview  

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior from an **Online Retail dataset**.  
By analyzing **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary Value (RFM)** features, the project identifies distinct customer groups such as **VIP customers**, **loyal regulars**, and **inactive buyers**.  

The insights help businesses design **personalized marketing strategies**, improve **customer retention**, and optimize **revenue growth**.

##  Problem Statement  

The objective is to **segment customers** of an online retail business into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior.  
This helps in understanding customer value and designing **targeted marketing strategies**.

---

## üîç Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Loading & Exploration**
- Loaded data from Excel (`online_retail_II.xlsx`).
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and data types.
- Identified and removed irrelevant or malformed records (missing Customer IDs, administrative transactions, etc.).

**Key Observations:**
- Multiple invalid or non-customer entries (e.g., postage, adjustments, test data).
- Missing `Customer ID` entries dropped since they can‚Äôt be tracked.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning**
- Filtered out **non-product StockCodes** (e.g., `POST`, `BANK CHARGES`, `TEST`, etc.).
- Retained only valid invoices and positive quantities.
- Handled null values and duplicates.
- Converted invoice and stock codes to string types for consistency.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**
Created RFM (Recency, Frequency, MonetaryValue) features for each customer:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Recency** | Days since the last purchase |
| **Frequency** | Number of unique invoices per customer |
| **MonetaryValue** | Total revenue generated by the customer |

A new column `Total_Sales = Quantity √ó Price` was introduced to compute spending.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized **histograms** and **boxplots** for all RFM features.
- Detected skewness and outliers across all metrics.
- Outliers were treated using the **IQR (Interquartile Range)** method.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Scaling**
- Standardized RFM features using `StandardScaler` to ensure equal contribution to clustering.
- Visualized the standardized data in **3D space** (MonetaryValue vs Frequency vs Recency).

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **K-Means Clustering**
- Used **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine optimal `k`.
- Optimal number of clusters found: **k = 4**.

**Evaluation Metrics Used:**
- **Inertia (WCSS)** ‚Äî measures compactness of clusters.  
- **Silhouette Score** ‚Äî evaluates how well-separated clusters are.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Cluster Visualization**
- Plotted **3D scatter plots** of clusters.
- Used **violin plots** to compare distribution of RFM features within each cluster.

**Cluster Color Codes:**
| Cluster | Color | Segment Name |
|:--------|:------|:--------------|
| 0 | üü¶ Blue | Inactive Customers |
| 1 | üü® Yellow | Dormant Customers |
| 2 | üü© Green | VIP Customers |
| 3 | üü• Red | Loyal Regular Customers |

---

###  **Customer Segment Insights**

| **Cluster (Color)** | **Recency** | **Frequency** | **Monetary Value** | **Customer Segment** | **Recommended Action** |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:---------------|:-------------------|:---------------------|:------------------------|
|  **VIP Customers** | Very Low (recent) | High | High | **Champions / VIPs** | Reward loyalty with exclusive offers, early access, or personalized perks. |
|  **Loyal Regulars** | Medium | Medium | High | **Regular Buyers** | Maintain engagement with loyalty programs and cross-sell campaigns. |
|  **Dormant Customers** | High | Low | Low | **At-Risk Customers** | Reactivate with reminders, targeted promotions, or surveys. |
|  **Inactive Customers** | Very High | Very Low | Very Low | **Lost Customers** | Send reactivation offers or win-back campaigns. |

---

###  **Final Visualization**
- Combined **cluster distribution** (bar chart) with **average scaled RFM values** (line chart).
- Provided a clear view of **customer proportions and behavior patterns** across clusters.

---

##  Key Results  

- **Optimal Clusters:** 4  
- **Best Silhouette Score:** ~0.53 (indicating fair separation)  
- **Dominant Segments:** VIP and Loyal Regular Customers  
- **Business Insight:**  
  - ~20% of customers generate the majority of revenue.  
  - Targeted marketing can increase retention and reduce churn.

---

## Next Steps  

- Integrate segmentation results into CRM systems.  
- Apply **DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering** for deeper behavioral grouping.  
- Build a **dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI)** for real-time customer analytics.
